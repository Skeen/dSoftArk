An obvious way to find which method(s) to sketch is by inspecting our
variability table, to find the method(s) that differ the most, and in our
implementation there's three winning strategies, so let's sketch that one;

\begin{lstlisting}
public Player getWinner(String gameType)
{
    // If Betaciv
    if (gameType = GameConstants.BetaCiv)
    {
        // Code
    }
    // Otherwise if EpsilonCiv
    else if(gameType = GameConstants.EpsilonCiv)
    {
        // Code
    }
    // Otherwise if ZetaCiv
    else if(gameType = GameConstants.ZetaCiv)
    {
        // Code
    }
    // Otherwise
    else
    {
        // Code
    }
}
\end{lstlisting}

Now all of the 'code' could either be inline, or it could be in functions,
however both of these alternatives are bad: 
The inline because it makes it hard to read the code and know which code is
for what, and because moving it into functions, makes variant specific code
available to every variant within game.

Another issue is that a change to one of the gameTypes, can possibly affect the
others, either because of an error, or simply because the change is in some of
the code that is shared.

Only a single function was sketched here, as other functions would simply be
alike this one.
