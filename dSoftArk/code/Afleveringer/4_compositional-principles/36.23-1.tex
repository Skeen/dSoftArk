The design, where all the variant specific code is within the class Game, results in a
largely unanalyzable code, as you always have to check which if statement is
for what. 
This is simply because all kind of specific code is within general code, and
one will always have to keep track of which code is specific and which code is
generic.

Also there's the issue that the game will have a larger set of
responsabilities, as it has to handle all of the variants.

And obviously there's the worst issue: that each change to variant code is
actually a change within the generic codebase, and it could possibly introduce
a defect wihtin the generic code.
