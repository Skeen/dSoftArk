Due to the fact that we're using a factory to produce our strategies, and
because we've decided to keep our production code free of variant specific code,
it does actually not require ANY changes to production code to support the
semiciv variant.
 All there's needed is to produce two classes, a strategy
factory, and a unitfactory somewhat alike the gammaunit factory, but
with specialized behavior for the settler.
