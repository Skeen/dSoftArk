The actual design suggested in the exercise, is somewhat alike what we have
developed.
Instead of making a purely polymorphic design, we have developed a composition
strategy factory, for the other strategies.
However, these concrete strategies are implemented with inheritance, such
that we only has to define the non-default strategies.
