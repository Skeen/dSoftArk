Our design is very much made with responsibility in mind. \\
 The Game interface is responsible for gamelogic. \\
 World is responsible for gameworld consistency, maintainance and
modification.\\
The implementation of Game, GameImpl, delegates some of it's responsibilities
in strategies such as determining winners of battles, the aging and winning of
the game or/and worldGeneration.

GameImpl additionally takes the role of initializing the game and all related components.
It supplies all the needed strategies to where these are used and needed. \\
 
To accomplish these responsibilites and roles, there are protocols in place
between game and world.\\
 GameImpl expects to recieve all the needed strategies through a Factory
pattern.\\
 WorldImp expects all modifications to the gameworld to be done through its
methods and expects to recieve a world gen strategy from Game.
