Implementation of the semiciv variant is, like we mentioned earlier, actually
very simple, as it's just a matter of implementing two classes. 
The first one, the strategy factory, is simply a matter of copy/pasting from the different
other strategy factories, such that our semiciv factory returns the correct
strategies for everything.
 However since we do not have a unitfactory, that only modifies the settler,
 we'll have to write a new unitfactory.

The development of the unitfactory is also really simple, as it's just a matter
of copying the gammaunitfactory, and deleting a few lines of code (those that
are within the Archer if statement). 
This is possible because unit's within our
unit factories are handled without affecting eachother.
