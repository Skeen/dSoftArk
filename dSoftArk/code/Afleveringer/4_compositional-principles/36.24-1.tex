In a programming language that supports multiple inheritance alike C++ or
Eiffel, one could implement SemiCiv simply by doing alike what we did, but
instead of just loading the default behavior, one could also load the specific
behavior of some functions by deciding which super class' function to
call.

For instance, in semiciv, we could simply extend all of the variants that we
make use of, and then override them, with calls to the specific super.
Fx for the winning strategy, we could simply call the
betasuper.getWinningStrategy().
