We have delegated the responsibility of specifying which strategies a game should be constructed with to an abstract factory: StrategyFactory.

An earlier version of the same class was named StrategyPackage, as it was build without the concept of Abstract Factory in mind.

Of course the name StrategyFactory is more appropriate now.
\\

Our experiments with abstract factory are mainly good. 

We have build upon the concept and specified a DefaultStrategyFactory, which all other StrategyFactories extends, so that we only need to specify the new strategies new variants introduce.

This is really nice, because the last few variants has only specified small changes to the alphaciv variant (and alphaciv is the default).
This means every new StrategyFactory can be kept small and easily readable.
