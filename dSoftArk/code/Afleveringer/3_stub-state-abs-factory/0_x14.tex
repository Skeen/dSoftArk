The ZetaCiv variant has been fully developed using only existing interfaces (after development on EpsilonCiv).

The solution specifies a new strategy that handles the responsibilities of both an AgeStrategy, to know when to change age, a WinStrategy, to change the outcome based on information in the other strategies, and a BattleStrategy, for ready access of the outcome of battles.

We have left it to the BackLog to refactor the new Strategy, so that it utilisess that it is based on existing strategies.
Fx could this be solved with this strategy just holding the already existing versions of the strategies, that it switches between.
