How to read this file:
Lines prepended with >> and appended with << describes the focus
of the TDD iteration.  Other lines are numbered depending on
which step in the TDD is occuring.
These are the steps:
    1. new test. Each TDD iteration starts with testing
    2. the test fails and why.
    3. The action taken in the attempt to make the test succeed.
       This step may mention principles used to add to the code.
       This step is followed by either 2 or 4.
    4. The test succeds. This step may describe the circumstances.
    5. Refactor. Not all iterations utilises this step, because
       it is not allways obvious what to refactor.


Our TDD iterations:
See the Devlog in the ../AlphaCiv/Devlog for earlier development.

>> Change the gameseed of WinStrategy to only use a limited
   interface of Game <<
5. Winning strategies currently need acces of Game.getAge,
   game.getCityAt and City.getOwner. So These were pulled into new
   superInterfaces so now named:
   GameAsSeen.getCityAt, GameAsSeen.getAge and
   CityAsSeen.getOwner.
   I hope this makes it clear that these are interfaces
   responsible for watching the state of Game and City that is
   relevant for the WinStrategies.
6. Succesfully refactorised.

>> Change the gameseed of WinStrategy to only use a limited
   interface of Game
   Change constructor of GameImpl to only take a single
   parameter: a GameStrategy, with the following methods:
    WinStrategy winningStrategy()
    AgeStrategy agingStrategy()
    WorldGenStrategy relevantStrategy()
<<
5. Constructed interface StrategyPackage with a getter method for
   each of the strategy-parameters in the constructor of GameImpl.
   Created an StrategyPackage implementation to handle
   Alphaciv-strategies.
   Likewise implemented StrategyPackages for each of the other
   Variants.
6. Succes: Green Bar on all tests.

5. A lot of refactoring has happened:
   *Implementation of defaultStrategies, which is just AlphaCivs Strategies
    moved and renamed. The remaining alphaCivStrategies are just extenden 
    from this defaultCiv.
    Other variants are changed to use this default to.
   *Restructure of Interfaces into 2 variants: superinterface with only accessors, and the subinterfaces with all mutators (Modifiables), and returntype of accessors as modifiables also.
   * Further which I have forgotten.
