--Rasmus Tilelist refactoring--
-------------------------------

Changing Arraylist with tiles to double array of tiles.
createMap in WorldGenStrategy now returns double arrays.
 changed AlphaWorld and DeltaWorld to return and work with double arrays.

getTileAt() changed to lookup in double array rather than loop over an arraylist.
All foreach loops over all tiles seaching for cities moved into getCityTiles, which returns a list of tiles that have cities.
All foreach loops over all tiles searching for units moved into getUnits, which returns a list of all units in the game.
